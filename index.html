            <h5>Front End Developer | Graphic Designer<br></h5>

            <br>I am a passionate front-end developer with a focus on crafting clean,
            efficient, and visually appealing websites. With experience in HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks, I have successfully built
            projects ranging from portfolio websites to dynamic web applications like
            calculators and restaurant sites. My work reflects a deep understanding
            of responsive design, user-centric interfaces, and modern web standards.<br></br>

            Currently, I am refining my skills by working on diverse projects, developing
            not just functional but engaging and interactive web solutions. My goal is to
            constantly innovate and stay ahead of web development trends while providing
            real-world solutions through my technical expertise.<br><br>

            I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and take on new challenges
            that push the boundaries of creativity and functionality in web 
            design.</br><br>

               <h4><span>Internship Experience at CodSoft</span></h4> <br>

               During my internship at CodSoft, I had the opportunity to sharpen
               my front-end development skills and gain practical experience by
               working on real-world projects.<br><br>
               
               I was involved in developing and 
               designing various web applications, including calculators, portfolio
               websites, and dynamic restaurant sites, all using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br></br>
                
               This hands-on experience allowed me to refine my understanding of 
               responsive design, improve my coding efficiency, and better 
               understand how to create user-friendly interfaces.<br><br>
            
               I also learned how to manage project deadlines effectively while
                maintaining
               code quality and collaborating with fellow developers.


                
                <br></br>The internship at CodSoft has significantly broadened 
                my knowledge in web development and given me valuable insights
                into industry standards and best practices.<br><br>
                
                I'm excited to apply
                the skills I've gained to future projects and continue growing
                as a developer.
